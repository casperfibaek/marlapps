In the mobile view, ensure that the settings button floats right
Settings and home buttons not needed (Title top left, and settings top right are already there.) Could search and categories be moved to the top? [left: Home-title, right: search, categories, settings] Search and categories should no be displayed once in the apps.
Clicking "home" on the launcher screen should trigger 'all apps' to be shown.
