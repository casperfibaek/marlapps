In the kanban app:
    Clicking filter scrolls the bars to the top left
    On hover, the tasks should display their full name in a tooltip (perhaps the tooltip functionality should be defined in app-common.css and styled in the theme?)
    When the list of tasks is collapsed, fix the border and border-radius on the column header.
    Remove the " add first task " button (its not needed, as there is the button to do so already close by)
    Create a visual indicator of where the task will be dropped when doing drag and drop of tasks, perhaps a dark line inbetween the tasks.
    Reduce the bottom padding/margin.


Home, search, and settings buttons could be floating - leaving more room for the apps.
Pomodoro app:
    Clicking settings ships the interface to the left

Improve the apps one by one - asking visual feedback on the interface
