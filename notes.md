Remove gaps between all apps list.

Categories does not show up as "white", like it is being hidden by something else. In general the see-through-ness is an issue. This also impacts other elements, such as search.
In the mobile view, ensure that the settings button floats right


Settings and home buttons not needed (Title top left, and settings top right are already there.) Search and categories buttons to be moved to the top [left: Home-title, right: search, categories, settings] Search and categories should no be displayed once inside the apps.
Clicking "home" on the launcher screen should trigger 'all apps' to be shown.
Sometimes when switching apps there is a quick flicker between the themes. Please make sure that there is no flicker.
Search functionality should be finding the closest match, up to a certain threshold. (use engrams at what they are called)
